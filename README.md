# Trade Registry

The Trade Registry, a centralized platform built with Django and deployed with PythonAnywhere, facilitates the registration and organization of your trades. Here are some of its features:

- You can register your trades with or without a sell date. If you register it without a sell date, the status will be ‘ongoing’, and the profit shown will assume it’s sold the moment the web page is refreshed.
- You can switch the profit to show percentage by clicking it.
- A simple page displays your registered trades.
- Users can sign up, login, change their passwords, and reset their passwords (if they’ve forgotten them).
